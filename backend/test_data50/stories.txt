On April 28, 2022, Russian invaders intensified air strikes, air- and sea-based cruise missile strike. Five Kalibr- and Kh-type missiles have been shot down over the past day. The enemy also increased the number of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs in the Ukrainian air space, which are successfully destroyed by our anti-aircraft defense systems.

By this heinous act of barbarism Russia demonstrates once again its attitude towards Ukraine, Europe and the world," the head of Ukrainian diplomacy tweeted.   As Ukrinform reported earlier, on Thursday Russian troops attacked the Ukrainian capital with missiles. As a result of the strikes, a 25-storey residential building was partially destroyed and 10 people were injured, according to preliminary reports. +@+ As Ukrinform earlier reported, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed in the southern regions the Russian electronic warfare station Repellent-1, three anti-aircraft guns, the Strela-10 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as a communications vehicle. Also, 42 Russian servicemen were eliminated over the past 24 hours.   There is enough information about this UAV in the public domain. It is a Russian project, but there is almost nothing Russian in Orlan-10, all the "stuffing" is imported from USA, Japan, China, Germany, etc.. The role of this should not be underestimated. "Orlan-10 can perform various tasks, including targeting, serving as a broadcaster or an interference asset.
