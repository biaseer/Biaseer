Prominent pro-Ukrainian journalist and Wilson Center fellow Kamil Galeev suggested that her father, Russian ultranationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, was likely aware of or even behind Dugina's killing, most probably in order to justify massive escalation against Ukraine on its independence day. He then seemed to endorse a theory from another prominent pro-Ukrainian journalist, Sergey Sumlenny, claiming that Dugin killed his daughter as an esoteric ritual sacrifice.
